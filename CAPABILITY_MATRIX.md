# Gateway panel capability matrix (0.10.0)

Scope: the local Claude Code plugin calls only existing Connexease Gateway API routes. Its tool inventory is not proof that every route is deployed in a particular environment. Automated HTTP-stub contract tests and MCP discovery run locally; account-specific writes below have not been executed against a live Gateway account in this version.

| Panel area | Plugin capability | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public documentation | Live, read-only answers with verified official links through `/connexease-gateway-ops:ask`; optional docs-only package for Claude/Codex and Gemini CLI skill | No Gateway login needed; documentation content does not authorize account actions. New-repository installs are not yet end-to-end verified |
| Account | Sign in, sign out, register, change/reset password, phone-code verification, onboarding organization assignment, profile and organization reads | Passwords and codes use native macOS dialogs; signing out reports local Keychain cleanup and remote revocation separately |
| Applications | List/detail, WhatsApp and Instagram health, WhatsApp business profile, Instagram profile, rename, contact update, WhatsApp username and suggestions | Mutations check application ownership and require native approval |
| WhatsApp templates | Paginated list/detail, template library/search/filters/detail, create/update/delete, media upload via native file picker | Submission is not Meta approval; media handle is returned to Claude, but local file path is not an AI argument |
| Sandbox | List/add/rename/delete test numbers; preview/send text or supported approved template; webhook test | Real sends are never automatic and have no automatic retry; product/carousel template sends are blocked |
| Webhooks | Read status, URL/events update, one native-entered secret header update, delete, test, sandbox webhook test | Header values never enter AI arguments/results; server receives one allowlisted write after approval |
| API keys and organization secrets | List redacted metadata, create with one-time local disclosure, revoke application API keys | No raw key is returned to Claude; organization-secret deletion is not exposed by the current panel helper |
| Organization and billing | Organization contact, allowed origins add/delete, wallet balance, billing account read/upsert, card metadata, invoices, coupon validation | No full card number or payment credential is returned |
| Insights | Summary, messages, categories, cost, cost by app, breakup pagination, raw export rows and panel-format CSV save; one named Insight widget at a time with a terminal table and monochrome Unicode line/bar chart; two explicit date ranges compared on the same widget with absolute/percentage deltas | CSV destination uses a native save dialog; existing files are not overwritten. Apps Overview remains mock/Coming Soon in the panel |

## Not completed by a local API-only plugin

- **New WhatsApp or Instagram connection:** the panel's Meta Embedded Signup is a browser OAuth flow with user interaction and a short-lived code. Calling only the final `connect` API is not a safe substitute. A browser handoff and supported authorization design are needed; backend changes may also be needed for a distributable multi-user integration.
- **Payment method setup and wallet top-up:** the existing API can create a Stripe SetupIntent or PaymentIntent, but the user still must complete Stripe Elements / 3-D Secure in a browser. The plugin deliberately does not initiate or confirm a charge blindly. Coupon validation and billing reads are available.
- **Full template send coverage:** current sandbox API/request validation cannot safely provide catalog/product selections for single/multi-product and carousel templates. Those sends stay blocked. Template creation and update submission are available, subject to backend/Meta validation.
- **Cross-AI web chat installation:** this package is a local stdio Claude Code plugin. ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude browser chat needs a hosted HTTPS MCP service with per-user OAuth; packaging the same local code is insufficient.
- **Live confidence:** registration, mutations, uploads, and payment-adjacent reads have local contract tests only. Verify against a dedicated staging account before promising production parity. Sandbox send success is Gateway acceptance, not delivery confirmation.

The plugin does not bypass existing API authorization or invent backend endpoints. If a route returns 404/422 in staging or production, treat that as an environment/API gap, not as a reason to call an undocumented endpoint.
